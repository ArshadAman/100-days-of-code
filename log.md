### Day 3: Jenuary 2, 2017 (Postcode Finder and Map)


**Today's Progress**: Learn a lot about API and more scpecifivally about geolocation and google maps.

**Thoughts:** A few months ago a made a project that you could find the postal code of an address. This time I wanted to step up my game!!! I combined the postal code project with a new one.
I used the google maps API so you can locate the area of that postal code (or you can just use it by address)...
The whole project took me a lot of hours, I expected to be easier.

### Day 4: Jenuary 3, 2017 (CSS and JS clock)


**Today's Progress**: I learned about transform/transition in css.

**Thoughts:** I have done a clock using js before, but it was a digital one... this time a made a classic one. I wanted to be very simple. My main focus was on transform/transition properties.

### Day 12: Jenuary 11, 2017 (Music App template with flexbox)


**Today's Progress**: So... I made a music app template with flexbox

**Thoughts:** I found [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af#.ti4hixn3e) article on medium about flexbox. Flexbox has so many properties I didn't know about. The article really helped me to learn how "flex" works. I can't remember how to use all the properties correctly but at least I know where to search in case I get lost!

### Day 13: Jenuary 12, 2017 (Must Know Dev Tools)


**Today's Progress**: Today I study some console.log tricks

**Thoughts:** In this project there is nothing special in html or css. But... I used the console.log, error, warn, clear, info, assert to get some useful info.

### Day 14: Jenuary 13, 2017 (Check Mulptiple Checkboxes)


**Today's Progress**: Hold shift to check multiple checkboxes. When a user clicks a checkbox, holds Shift, and then clicks another checkbox a few rows down, all the checkboxes inbetween those two checkboxes should be checked.

**Thoughts:** I learned about handleCheck in js, how to detect if a key is pressed and how to check multiple boxes by holding shift. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 15: Jenuary 14, 2017 (Custom HTML video player)


**Today's Progress**: I made a HTML5 video player!

**Thoughts:** I think it's very useful to know hot to customize everything in a video player. This video player is full functionall and works without many components which means it will load fast and for every browser. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 16: Jenuary 15, 2017 (Secret Password - Key Detection)


**Today's Progress**: I made a key detection programma that can be used for games, for fun or anything else. In order to make it a lit bit cooler I add the "cornify.js" so we can see unicorns

**Thoughts:**The key detection and especially in this way, was my first time using it. The line "pressed.splice(-secretCode.length - 1, pressed.length - secretCode.length);" was interesting enough, as the detection degins from the end to the front. And although I am a liitle bit of 90's kid, I also didn't know about the cornify_add(); (this is the function that shows the unicorns). This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 17: Jenuary 16, 2017 (Slide on Scroll)


**Today's Progress**: This is a simple project but once again I learn some usefull things about js and css.

**Thoughts:**The new parts are: window events and scrollY and some maths! This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 18: Jenuary 17, 2017 (Objects and Arrays)


**Today's Progress**: Today was about objects and arrays, javascript references vs copies. You can check the javascript console to see more details.

**Thoughts:** This is not a fancy project, this is pure javascript and the capabilities of ES6. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 19: Jenuary 18, 2017 (Move mouse with Shadows)


**Today's Progress**: This is a fun project. You can move the mouse and you will see some shadows. You can control the shadows from the css file.

**Thoughts:**I learn some more things about shadows. There is again some maths! But I like maths so this is alwas something fun. I laso used for the first time emojis. You just have to use a library and then it s easy. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 20: Jenuary 19, 2017 (Sort Array Without Articles)


**Today's Progress**: In this project I use replace() and trim() to cut out the articles, then sort() to sort the array and finally map() and join() to present the strings in the array in the html section. There isn't much of html or css. 

**Thoughts:** I didnt know the sort function can work in strings too! Also I made the comparison of the strings in just on line and without using else-if statement whch I think is pretty cool. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 21: Jenuary 20, 2017 (Circular Progress Loader canvas with javascript)


**Today's Progress**: This project is a nice circular progress loader using canvas and some javascript. Reload the page to see the effect again. 

**Thoughts:** I have to learn more things about canvas. I think you can create some very interesting projects with canvas. Inspiration from here: https://www.developphp.com/

### Day 22: Jenuary 21, 2017 (Trigger CSS Transitions to Control Animations)


**Today's Progress**: This project demontstrates: how to trigger CSS transition animations using JavaScript
1st animation: Change and reset the bg-color
2nd animation: Fade-in Fade-out 

**Thoughts:** I like transitions, they can make a project look very cool. Of cource the transition I used here are very simple, but first you have to do the simple stuff and then go to the big ones!

### Day 23: Jenuary 22, 2017 (Twitter Api - Multiple Posts at real time)


**Today's Progress**: I ve been searching the web for a while, until I found a twitter Api

**Thoughts:** I like this api very much. I have to admit it not enterly my job. It is in real time, you can configure it as you like and have multiple posts. This is certanly something I will use in my webpage

### Day 24: Jenuary 23, 2017 (Adding-up times with reduce)


**Today's Progress**: I sum up times of videos. This was my first time using reduce.

**Thoughts:** Except from reduce I also find some new ways to use .map, pasrefloat function and mod. Back in my days in the university we were using mod (%) for many projects but latelly I didn't do anything with it. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

**Link to work:**Adding-up times with reduce [Codepen](http://codepen.io/EleftheriaBatsou/full/RKgKjG/) or [Github](https://eleftheriabatsou.github.io/adding-up-times-with-reduce/)


### Day 25: Jenuary 24, 2017 (Restaurant menu with Local Storage and Event Delegation)


**Today's Progress**: Today I did a "restaurant menu" that you can add or delete your dishes.

**Thoughts:** This project was about things: 1)Local storage: if someone refresh the page, everything will be still there 2)Event delegation: when someone adds an item, he can click on it and tackle it. Local storage can be used in to-do lists. This time a made a "resaturant-menu" but next time it can be a "to-do list".  This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 26: Jenuary 25, 2017 (Unreal WebCam Fun)


**Today's Progress**: I made my own filters for webcam

**Thoughts:** This progect needs php. I tried to open my webcam through localhost since I arleady had configured my xamp server but I coludn't make my camera working. Fortunatelly, everything works good in github. 
To make the filters you have to know some maths and a litle bit of color-theory. I saw some very helpful tutorials to help me understand how filters work. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 27: Jenuary 26, 2017 (Native Speech Recognition)


**Today's Progress**: Speak and the program will try to write everything down for you!

**Thoughts:** This progect needs php so once again I had to use github. I didn't know that you could do something like this with only some javascript. I enjoied native speech recognition.
This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 28: Jenuary 27, 2017 (Geolocation)


**Today's Progress**: I followed the tutorial from javascript30 and I made a geolocation simple project.

**Thoughts:** This progect needs php so once again I had to use github. This is my 3rd project using geolocation. I think you can creat many cools projects with geolocation. This project will only work on mac :(

### Day 29: Jenuary 28, 2017 (Follow alogn links)


**Today's Progress**: Hover over everything and watch the effect! The text and the links are highlighted in a beautiful way!

**Thoughts:** I learn about highlighting effect with css and javascript.
This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 30: Jenuary 29, 2017 (Speech Synthesis)


**Today's Progress**: Select voice, rate and pitch. You can listen to everything you type in the box.

**Thoughts:** Some voices can be a little slow as loading takes some time. In safari there are propably more options in voice rather than chrome. I think this project can be very useful. I remember doing something similiar in python for my diploma thesis.

### Day 31: Jenuary 30, 2017 (Sticky Nav)


**Today's Progress**: When you scroll the menu bar (or sticky nav) it  will stay at the top of the screen and it will also add an effect. 

**Thoughts:** The effect is simply a padding-left with html and a transormation: scale(1) with css. Although the code isn't many lines, yet the result is beautiful.
This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 32: Jenuary 31, 2017 (Event capturing, propagation, bubbling and property once)


**Today's Progress**: Today I learn about: add event listener, propagation, event capturing, bubbling and the property once.

**Thoughts:** Here are some notes about the new properties: 
-Bubbling: when you click an event then everything that is up to this level will also be clicked.
-The browser will first capture, which means that when you click on the element it will ripple it down. The capture is from top down, and then it will bubble up.
-Once is a very new property. If it's equal to true, it will listen for a click and then unbind the event, which is the same as remove.
This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 33: February 1, 2017 (Stripe Follow Along Nav)


**Today's Progress**: I learn about some css tricks like animations with two seperate classes (e.x. .trigger-enter .dropdown and .trigger-enter-active .dropdown)

**Thoughts:** This project can be used in a vary of manus and nav bars. The advantage of the code is that it's responsive and it 'll follow the lenght of the text.
