### Day 3: Jenuary 2, 2017 (Postcode Finder and Map)


**Today's Progress**: Learn a lot about API and more scpecifivally about geolocation and google maps.

**Thoughts:** A few months ago a made a project that you could find the postal code of an address. This time I wanted to step up my game!!! I combined the postal code project with a new one.
I used the google maps API so you can locate the area of that postal code (or you can just use it by address)...
The whole project took me a lot of hours, I expected to be easier.

### Day 4: Jenuary 3, 2017 (CSS and JS clock)


**Today's Progress**: I learned about transform/transition in css.

**Thoughts:** I have done a clock using js before, but it was a digital one... this time a made a classic one. I wanted to be very simple. My main focus was on transform/transition properties.

### Day 12: Jenuary 11, 2017 (Music App template with flexbox)


**Today's Progress**: So... I made a music app template with flexbox

**Thoughts:** I found [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af#.ti4hixn3e) article on medium about flexbox. Flexbox has so many properties I didn't know about. The article really helped me to learn how "flex" works. I can't remember how to use all the properties correctly but at least I know where to search in case I get lost!

**Thoughts:** In this project there is nothing special in html or css. But... I used the console.log, error, warn, clear, info, assert to get some useful info.
