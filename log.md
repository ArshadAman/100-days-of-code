# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2016 (Detect User Browser)

**Today's Progress**: Finished with html, css and js.

**Thoughts:** This is a useful and easy way to detect the user's browser!
It detects: Chrome,Firefox,Safari,Opera,MSIE,Trident,Edge, Internet Explorer.

**Today's Progress**: Learn about key events, playing audio, listening for end event, animations 

**Thoughts:** I did not know many things about "eventListener", I used to implement these kind of things with jquery, but not this time!!!

### Day 3: Jenuary 2, 2017 (Postcode Finder and Map)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Learn a lot about API and more scpecifivally about geolocation and google maps.

**Thoughts:** A few months ago a made a project that you could find the postal code of an address. This time I wanted to step up my game!!! I combined the postal code project with a new one.
I used the google maps API so you can locate the area of that postal code (or you can just use it by address)...
The whole project took me a lot of hours, I expected to be easier.
