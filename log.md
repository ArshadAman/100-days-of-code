### Day 3: Jenuary 2, 2017 (Postcode Finder and Map)


**Today's Progress**: Learn a lot about API and more scpecifivally about geolocation and google maps.

**Thoughts:** A few months ago a made a project that you could find the postal code of an address. This time I wanted to step up my game!!! I combined the postal code project with a new one.
I used the google maps API so you can locate the area of that postal code (or you can just use it by address)...
The whole project took me a lot of hours, I expected to be easier.

### Day 12: Jenuary 11, 2017 (Music App template with flexbox)


**Today's Progress**: So... I made a music app template with flexbox

**Thoughts:** I found [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af#.ti4hixn3e) article on medium about flexbox. Flexbox has so many properties I didn't know about. The article really helped me to learn how "flex" works. I can't remember how to use all the properties correctly but at least I know where to search in case I get lost!

### Day 16: Jenuary 15, 2017 (Secret Password - Key Detection)


**Today's Progress**: I made a key detection programma that can be used for games, for fun or anything else. In order to make it a lit bit cooler I add the "cornify.js" so we can see unicorns

**Thoughts:**The key detection and especially in this way, was my first time using it. The line "pressed.splice(-secretCode.length - 1, pressed.length - secretCode.length);" was interesting enough, as the detection degins from the end to the front. And although I am a liitle bit of 90's kid, I also didn't know about the cornify_add(); (this is the function that shows the unicorns). This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 18: Jenuary 17, 2017 (Objects and Arrays)


**Today's Progress**: Today was about objects and arrays, javascript references vs copies. You can check the javascript console to see more details.

**Thoughts:** This is not a fancy project, this is pure javascript and the capabilities of ES6. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 19: Jenuary 18, 2017 (Move mouse with Shadows)


**Today's Progress**: This is a fun project. You can move the mouse and you will see some shadows. You can control the shadows from the css file.

**Thoughts:**I learn some more things about shadows. There is again some maths! But I like maths so this is alwas something fun. I laso used for the first time emojis. You just have to use a library and then it s easy. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 20: Jenuary 19, 2017 (Sort Array Without Articles)


**Today's Progress**: In this project I use replace() and trim() to cut out the articles, then sort() to sort the array and finally map() and join() to present the strings in the array in the html section. There isn't much of html or css. 

**Thoughts:** I didnt know the sort function can work in strings too! Also I made the comparison of the strings in just on line and without using else-if statement whch I think is pretty cool. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 22: Jenuary 21, 2017 (Trigger CSS Transitions to Control Animations)


**Today's Progress**: This project demontstrates: how to trigger CSS transition animations using JavaScript
1st animation: Change and reset the bg-color
2nd animation: Fade-in Fade-out 

**Thoughts:** I like transitions, they can make a project look very cool. Of cource the transition I used here are very simple, but first you have to do the simple stuff and then go to the big ones!

### Day 23: Jenuary 22, 2017 (Twitter Api - Multiple Posts at real time)


**Today's Progress**: I ve been searching the web for a while, until I found a twitter Api

**Thoughts:** I like this api very much. I have to admit it not enterly my job. It is in real time, you can configure it as you like and have multiple posts. This is certanly something I will use in my webpage

### Day 24: Jenuary 23, 2017 (Adding-up times with reduce)


**Today's Progress**: I sum up times of videos. This was my first time using reduce.

**Thoughts:** Except from reduce I also find some new ways to use .map, pasrefloat function and mod. Back in my days in the university we were using mod (%) for many projects but latelly I didn't do anything with it. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

**Link to work:**Adding-up times with reduce [Codepen](http://codepen.io/EleftheriaBatsou/full/RKgKjG/) or [Github](https://eleftheriabatsou.github.io/adding-up-times-with-reduce/)


### Day 25: Jenuary 24, 2017 (Restaurant menu with Local Storage and Event Delegation)


**Today's Progress**: Today I did a "restaurant menu" that you can add or delete your dishes.

**Thoughts:** This project was about things: 1)Local storage: if someone refresh the page, everything will be still there 2)Event delegation: when someone adds an item, he can click on it and tackle it. Local storage can be used in to-do lists. This time a made a "resaturant-menu" but next time it can be a "to-do list".  This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 26: Jenuary 25, 2017 (Unreal WebCam Fun)


**Today's Progress**: I made my own filters for webcam

**Thoughts:** This progect needs php. I tried to open my webcam through localhost since I arleady had configured my xamp server but I coludn't make my camera working. Fortunatelly, everything works good in github. 
To make the filters you have to know some maths and a litle bit of color-theory. I saw some very helpful tutorials to help me understand how filters work. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 27: Jenuary 26, 2017 (Native Speech Recognition)


**Today's Progress**: Speak and the program will try to write everything down for you!

**Thoughts:** This progect needs php so once again I had to use github. I didn't know that you could do something like this with only some javascript. I enjoied native speech recognition.

### Day 28: Jenuary 27, 2017 (Geolocation)


**Today's Progress**: I followed the tutorial from javascript30 and I made a geolocation simple project.

**Thoughts:** This progect needs php so once again I had to use github. This is my 3rd project using geolocation. I think you can creat many cools projects with geolocation. This project will only work on mac :(

### Day 29: Jenuary 28, 2017 (Follow alogn links)


**Today's Progress**: Hover over everything and watch the effect! The text and the links are highlighted in a beautiful way!

**Thoughts:** I learn about highlighting effect with css and javascript.
This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 30: Jenuary 29, 2017 (Speech Synthesis)


**Today's Progress**: Select voice, rate and pitch. You can listen to everything you type in the box.

**Thoughts:** Some voices can be a little slow as loading takes some time. In safari there are propably more options in voice rather than chrome. I think this project can be very useful. I remember doing something similiar in python for my diploma thesis.

### Day 31: Jenuary 30, 2017 (Sticky Nav)


**Today's Progress**: When you scroll the menu bar (or sticky nav) it  will stay at the top of the screen and it will also add an effect. 

**Thoughts:** The effect is simply a padding-left with html and a transormation: scale(1) with css. Although the code isn't many lines, yet the result is beautiful.

### Day 32: Jenuary 31, 2017 (Event capturing, propagation, bubbling and property once)


**Today's Progress**: Today I learn about: add event listener, propagation, event capturing, bubbling and the property once.

**Thoughts:** Here are some notes about the new properties: 
-Bubbling: when you click an event then everything that is up to this level will also be clicked.
-The browser will first capture, which means that when you click on the element it will ripple it down. The capture is from top down, and then it will bubble up.
-Once is a very new property. If it's equal to true, it will listen for a click and then unbind the event, which is the same as remove.

### Day 33: February 1, 2017 (Stripe Follow Along Nav)


**Today's Progress**: I learn about some css tricks like animations with two separate classes (e.x. .trigger-enter .dropdown and .trigger-enter-active .dropdown)

**Thoughts:** This project can be used in a vary of manus and nav bars. The advantage of the code is that it's responsive and it 'll follow the lenght of the text.

### Day 34: February 2, 2017 (Click and drag)


**Today's Progress**: Click and drag to see the vertical effect

**Thoughts:** Simpl-ish code, you have to make some variables and then caption at time when the mouse is down and then reference when somebody moves the mouse.
This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 35: February 3, 2017 (Video Speed Controller)


**Today's Progress**: Scroll the right column to make the speed faster or slower

**Thoughts:** Today I combined two things: mouse move events and html5 videos properties. I have used events and html5 videos in other projects too, but I like the idea of a video speed controller.
*The video must end with the parameter ?dl=1
The original video from youtube: https://youtu.be/vQ2A1pOchFM

### Day 36: February 4, 2017 (Countdown Timer)


**Today's Progress**: This is a countdown timer, similar to Pomodoro clocks. You can schedule your own break, watch the countdown and also the time you have to return, or you can choose time/break by the predefined buttons.

**Thoughts:** The javascript part was a little bit confusing.

### Day 37: February 5, 2017 (Whack-a-mole)


**Today's Progress**: Whack - a - mole game with js! 
Press start and begin the game. The duration of the game is 10 seconds. 

**Thoughts:** The bird pops up randomly from the hole, try to click on it. You can click it as many times as possible to get a greater score. The score is displayed at the top right corner. To play again, refresh the page.

### Day 38: February 6, 2017 (Start Stop CSS keyframes animation with JS)


**Today's Progress**: Today I made a ball to move horizontally! You can press start and button to control the ball 

**Thoughts:** I learn how to program interactive CSS3 keyframes animations. Meaning that you allow the user to control the animation in specific ways, which can be done through JavaScript event handling.

### Day 40: February 8, 2017 (Transform Rotate Image Spin Smooth Animation)


**Today's Progress**: I learn how to program any CSS property animations using JavaScript and the CSS3 transform property, with just a few lines of code. 

**Thoughts:** JavaScript offers to animations more flexibility regarding user interactivity with your animations. CSS alone cannot offer you all of the DOM event handlers that are useful for programming advanced interactivity with the animated elements.

### Day 41: February 9, 2017 (Bubbles Slideshow Application)


**Today's Progress**: I made a bubble slideshow application that you can implement into your projects and customize to your liking. 

**Thoughts:** Every line of JavaScript is well commented so that you can determine what is happening in the script more easily and alter it. I have use images but we can also use content. The slideshow automatically changes content every 5 seconds.

### Day 42: February 10, 2017 (Material Design Colors)


**Today's Progress**: This project is a palette of material design colors.  

**Thoughts:** I usually search a lot to combine colors, so I made my own "color picker" to save some time of future projects.
There are 12 fifferent colors and 6 different variations for each one.
I didn't use all the colors, for example, there aren't any variations of white/black

### Day 43: February 11, 2017 (Not your usual buttons)

**Today's Progress**: A collection of buttons. Thick or thin, lined, dotted or dashed. Animations, transformations and more. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to make something with scss as I always code in css, so I thought a project with buttons would't be that bad. We all use buttons and many times we decorate them in our own unique ways, that's what I tryied to do also today.

### Day 44: February 12, 2017 (Koala - Pure CSS)

**Today's Progress**: I am planning on taking the challenge #dailycssimages. This is my first time trying to do an image of a "koala" using only css. 

**Thoughts:** I followed this guide here https://medium.com/dailycssimages/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2#.yznl0pgs6
I am sure I will learn so many new things with challenge, I love cute little things and that's what I am planning to make. I have to admit that I am awful at drawing with hand but I will challenge myself to do better with some code.

### Day 45: February 13, 2017 (Vertical Timeline - My life)

**Today's Progress**: Building a Vertical Timeline With CSS and a Touch of JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I decide to make the story with the basic facts about my life. There isn't much js and the code is pretty simple. I also used scss. I found slowly myslef prefering scss rather than css. I guess that's good.
