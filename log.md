### Day 2: Jenuary 1, 2017 (Drum Kit)

### Day 3: Jenuary 2, 2017 (Postcode Finder and Map)


**Today's Progress**: Learn a lot about API and more scpecifivally about geolocation and google maps.

**Thoughts:** A few months ago a made a project that you could find the postal code of an address. This time I wanted to step up my game!!! I combined the postal code project with a new one.
I used the google maps API so you can locate the area of that postal code (or you can just use it by address)...
The whole project took me a lot of hours, I expected to be easier.

### Day 4: Jenuary 3, 2017 (CSS and JS clock)


**Today's Progress**: I learned about transform/transition in css.

**Thoughts:** I have done a clock using js before, but it was a digital one... this time a made a classic one. I wanted to be very simple. My main focus was on transform/transition properties.

**Today's Progress**: I learned about updating css variables with js. It's a very simple project but I like it!

### Day 12: Jenuary 11, 2017 (Music App template with flexbox)


**Today's Progress**: So... I made a music app template with flexbox

**Thoughts:** I found [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af#.ti4hixn3e) article on medium about flexbox. Flexbox has so many properties I didn't know about. The article really helped me to learn how "flex" works. I can't remember how to use all the properties correctly but at least I know where to search in case I get lost!

### Day 13: Jenuary 12, 2017 (Must Know Dev Tools)


**Today's Progress**: Today I study some console.log tricks

**Thoughts:** In this project there is nothing special in html or css. But... I used the console.log, error, warn, clear, info, assert to get some useful info.

### Day 14: Jenuary 13, 2017 (Check Mulptiple Checkboxes)


**Today's Progress**: Hold shift to check multiple checkboxes. When a user clicks a checkbox, holds Shift, and then clicks another checkbox a few rows down, all the checkboxes inbetween those two checkboxes should be checked.

**Thoughts:** I learned about handleCheck in js, how to detect if a key is pressed and how to check multiple boxes by holding shift. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 15: Jenuary 14, 2017 (Custom HTML video player)


**Today's Progress**: I made a HTML5 video player!

**Thoughts:** I think it's very useful to know hot to customize everything in a video player. This video player is full functionall and works without many components which means it will load fast and for every browser. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 16: Jenuary 15, 2017 (Secret Password - Key Detection)


**Today's Progress**: I made a key detection programma that can be used for games, for fun or anything else. In order to make it a lit bit cooler I add the "cornify.js" so we can see unicorns

**Thoughts:**The key detection and especially in this way, was my first time using it. The line "pressed.splice(-secretCode.length - 1, pressed.length - secretCode.length);" was interesting enough, as the detection degins from the end to the front. And although I am a liitle bit of 90's kid, I also didn't know about the cornify_add(); (this is the function that shows the unicorns). This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 17: Jenuary 16, 2017 (Slide on Scroll)


**Today's Progress**: This is a simple project but once again I learn some usefull things about js and css.

**Thoughts:**The new parts are: window events and scrollY and some maths! This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com

### Day 18: Jenuary 17, 2017 (Objects and Arrays)


**Today's Progress**: Today was about objects and arrays, javascript references vs copies. You can check the javascript console to see more details.

**Thoughts:** This is not a fancy project, this is pure javascript and the capabilities of ES6. This project was inspired by: https://javascript30.com
