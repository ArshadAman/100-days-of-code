# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2016 (Detect User Browser)


**Today's Progress**: Finished with html, css and js.

**Thoughts:** This is a useful and easy way to detect the user's browser!
It detects: Chrome,Firefox,Safari,Opera,MSIE,Trident,Edge, Internet Explorer.

### Day 2: Jenuary 1, 2017 (Drum Kit)


**Today's Progress**: Learn about key events, playing audio, listening for end event, animations 

**Thoughts:** I did not know many things about "eventListener", I used to implement these kind of things with jquery, but not this time!!!

### Day 3: Jenuary 2, 2017 (Postcode Finder and Map)


**Today's Progress**: Learn a lot about API and more scpecifivally about geolocation and google maps.

**Thoughts:** A few months ago a made a project that you could find the postal code of an address. This time I wanted to step up my game!!! I combined the postal code project with a new one.
I used the google maps API so you can locate the area of that postal code (or you can just use it by address)...
The whole project took me a lot of hours, I expected to be easier.

### Day 4: Jenuary 3, 2017 (CSS and JS clock)


**Today's Progress**: I learned about transform/transition in css.

**Thoughts:** I have done a clock using js before, but it was a digital one... this time a made a classic one. I wanted to be very simple. My main focus was on transform/transition properties.

### Day 5: Jenuary 4, 2017 (Update CSS Variables with JS)


**Today's Progress**: I learned about updating css variables with js. It's a very simple project but I like it!

**Thoughts:** I 've never done a similar project. I learn some new stuff about CSS and more specific about how to use variables as I though this is something that can only be done with SCSS

### Day 6: Jenuary 5, 2017 (Collision Detection Hit Game Enemies)


**Today's Progress**: I refresh my memory about css and the image as a cover... and I also learn some new things in js.

**Thoughts:** I liked this game. I think it can be improved in many was, and I would like in the future to keep working on that project
